            <h2>About the Satellite</h2>
            <p>Artificial intelligence is undergoing a profound conceptual shift, driven by the realization that many of its current limitations stem from architectural and computational assumptions disentangled from the organizing principles of natural intelligent complex connected systems. </p>
            <br>

            <p>NSIA explore how network science can provide foundational insights for the next generation of AI, moving beyond dense, homogeneous, and gradient-centric models toward architectures grounded in topology, sparsity, dynamics, and local learning rules.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The aims of the satellite are to:</p>
            <br>
                <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
                    <li><strong>Articulate the theoretical principles</strong> by which network topology, higher-order interactions, and emergent structures can shape computation and learning in artificial systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Showcase recent advances</strong> in network-based AI, including models that leverage brain-inspired connectivity, dynamic sparsity, Hebbian-like local rules, network geometry embeddings, and topological self-organization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Build a cross-disciplinary dialogue</strong> between network scientists, machine learning researchers, neuroscientists, physicists, and theorists, with the goal of identifying the key mechanisms by which natural networks achieve efficiency, adaptability, and intelligence—and translating these mechanisms into new AI frameworks.</li>
                </ul>
        <br>
        <p>By positioning network science as a generative engine for new computational principles, this satellite aims to catalyze a paradigm in which network structure is not only analyzed, but actively engineered as a core driver of artificial intelligence.</p>
